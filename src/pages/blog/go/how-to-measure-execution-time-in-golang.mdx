# How to measure execution time in Go <SectionLink client:load id="how-to-measure-execution-time-in-go" />

To measure execution time in Golang we use `time.Now()` and `time.Since()` functions.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)


func main() {
    start := time.Now()
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    fmt.Println("Time elapsed: ", elapsed)
}
```

Output:

```bash title="output"
Time elapsed:  2.0020002s
```

We can also use `time.Now().Sub()` function to measure execution time.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    start := time.Now()
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    elapsed := time.Now().Sub(start)
    fmt.Println("Time elapsed: ", elapsed)
}
```

Output:

```bash title="output"
Time elapsed:  2.0020002s
```

We can also use `time.Now().UnixNano()` function to measure execution time.

```go title="main.go"
// ....

func main () {
    start := time.Now().UnixNano()
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    elapsed := time.Now().UnixNano() - start
    fmt.Println("Time elapsed: ", elapsed)
}
```

Output:

```bash title="output"
"Time elapsed:  2002000000"
```

A better way to measure execution time of a function is to use the <Link url="/blog/go/golang-tests/"> testing </Link> package and perfom a benchmark test.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func myFunction() {
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}

func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

```go title="main_test.go"
package main

import (
    "testing"
)

func BenchmarkMyFunction(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        myFunction()
    }
}
```

On running the tests we get the execution time of the function after running `b.N` times which is the number of iterations.
