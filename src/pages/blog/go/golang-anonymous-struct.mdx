## What are Anonymous Structs in Golang? <SectionLink id= "what-are-anonymous-structs-in-golang" />

An anonymous struct is a struct without a name. It is used to create a struct on the fly without having to define a struct type. It is also useful when you want to create a struct with a single field.

## How to create an Anonymous Struct in Golang <SectionLink id= "how-to-create-an-anonymous-struct-in-golang" />

To create an anonymous struct, you can use the following syntax:

```go title="main.go"
...
<var>:= struct {
    <field> type
}{
    field: value,
}
...
```

In the above syntax, `<var>` is the variable name of the anonymous struct, `<field>` is the field name of the anonymous struct, and `type` is the type of the field. The value of the field is assigned to the variable using the `field: value` syntax. The value of the field can be any valid value of the type of field.

Example:

```go title="main.go"
...
s1 := struct {
    name string
    age  int
}{
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}
...
```

## How to access the fields of an Anonymous Struct in Golang <SectionLink id= "how-to-access-the-fields-of-an-anonymous-struct-in-golang" />

To access the fields of an anonymous struct the `.` operator can be used. The syntax is as follows:

```go title="main.go"
...
s1 := struct {
    name string
    age  int
}{
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}

fmt.Println(s1.name) // John
fmt.Println(s1.age) // 30
```

## Anonymous struct array in Golang <SectionLink id= "anonymous-struct-array-in-golang" />

Anonymous structs can be used to create an array of structs. The syntax is as follows:

```go title="main.go"
...
s := [3]struct {
    name string
    age  int
}{
    {
        name: "John",
        age:  30,
    },
    {
        name: "Mary",
        age:  25,
    },
    {
        name: "Peter",
        age:  35,
    },
}

fmt.Println(s[0].name) // John
fmt.Println(s[0].age) // 30
fmt.Println(s[1].name) // Mary
fmt.Println(s[1].age) // 25
fmt.Println(s[2].name) // Peter
fmt.Println(s[2].age) // 35
```

In the example above, an array of anonymous structs is created. The array has 3 elements. Each element is an anonymous struct with the `name` and `age` fields.

Since slices are built on top of arrays, anonymous structs can also be used to create a slice of structs.

## Anonymous struct with a method in Golang <SectionLink id= "anonymous-struct-with-a-method-in-golang" />

Anonymous structs can also have methods. The syntax is as follows:

```go title="main.go"
...
s1 := struct {
    name string
    age  int
}{
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}

func (s struct {
    name string
    age  int
}) greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello", s.name)
}

s1.greet() // Hello John
```

In the example above, a method `greet()` for the anonymous struct `s1` is created. The method `greet()` takes the anonymous struct as a receiver. The `greet()` method can be called on the `s1` variable.

## Anonymous struct interface in Golang <SectionLink id= "anonymous-struct-interface-in-golang" />

Anonymous structs can also implement an interface. The syntax is as follows:

```go title="main.go"
...
type person interface {
    greet()
}

s1 := struct {
    name string
    age  int
}{
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}

func (s struct {
    name string
    age  int
}) greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello", s.name)
}

func sayHello(p person) {
    p.greet()
}

sayHello(s1) // Hello John
```

In the example above, the anonymous struct `s1` implements the `person` interface. The `sayHello()` function takes the `person` interface as a parameter. The `s1` variable is passed to the `sayHello()` function. The `s1` variable implements the `person` interface, so it can be passed to the `sayHello()` function.

## Nested Anonymous Structs in Golang <SectionLink id= "nested-anonymous-structs-in-golang" />

Anonymous structs can be nested. The syntax is as follows:

```go title="main.go"
...
s1 := struct {
    name string
    age  int
    address struct {
        street string
        city   string
    }
}{
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
    address: struct {
        street string
        city   string
    }{
        street: "Main Street",
        city:   "New York",
    },
}

fmt.Println(s1.name) // John
fmt.Println(s1.age) // 30
fmt.Println(s1.address.street) // Main Street
fmt.Println(s1.address.city) // New York
```

In the example above, the `address` field of the anonymous struct `s1` is a nested anonymous struct.

## Conclusion <SectionLink id= "conclusion" />

Anonymous structs are useful when you need to create a struct quickly without defining a struct type. They can also be used to construct an array or a struct slice. Anonymous structs can also implement interfaces and have methods. Anonymous structs can be nested as well.
