## Introduction

In Go, a constant is an immutable value that can be used in place of a variable. Constants can be string, boolean, or numeric values. Constants cannot be declared using the `:= `syntax.

## How to declare a constant <SectionLink client:load id="how-to-declare-a-constant" />

Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword. The `:=` syntax is only used for declaring variables. This forms one of the main differences between constants and variables.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
  fmt.Println(Pi)
}
```

`Pi` is a constant of type `float64` and can be used in place of a variable.

## How to declare multiple constants <SectionLink client:load id="how-to-declare-multiple-constants" />

To declare multiple constants, use the `const` and place the variables in a parenthesis.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  const (
    Pi = 3.14
    Language = "Go"
    Version = 1.19
  )

  fmt.Println(Pi, Language, Version)
}
```

Here we have declared three constants of type `float64`, `string`, and `int`.

The output of the above code is:

```bash title="output"
3.14 Go 1.19
```

## How to declare a constant with an explicit type <SectionLink client:load id="how-to-declare-a-constant-with-an-explicit-type" />

Even though constants are immutable, they can still have an explicit type. This is done by placing the type after the constant name.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  const (
    Pi float64 = 3.14
    Language string = "Go"
    Random int = 10e6
  )

    fmt.Printf("%T %T %T\n", Pi, Language, Version)
}
```

The output of the above code is:

```bash title="output"
float64 string int
```

## How to declare custom types as constants <SectionLink client:load id="how-to-declare-custom-types-as-constants" />

The same rules apply to custom types as they do to built-in types. This means that custom types can be declared as constants.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

type Language string

const (
  Go Language = "Go"
  Python Language = "Python"
  JavaScript Language = "JavaScript"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println(Go, Python, JavaScript)
}
```

Only custom types that are based on built-in types that can be constants can be constants.

## Constant edge cases <SectionLink client:load id="constant-edge-cases" />

### Maps cannot be constants <SectionLink client:load id="maps-cannot-be-constants" />

Maps cannot be constants because they are mutable. This is because the length of a map is not known at compile time.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  const m = map[string]int{
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
  }

  fmt.Println(m)
}
```

The output of the above code is:

```bash title="output"
./main.go:6:13: map[string]int{â€¦} (value of type map[string]int) is not constant
```

### Constant values should be known at compile time <SectionLink client:load id="constant-values-should-be-known-at-compile-time" />

Constant values should be known at compile time. This means that the value of a constant should be able to be determined at compile time. This includes values that are the result of a function call.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  const Pi = math.Pi

  fmt.Println(Pi)
}
```

The output of the above code is:

```bash title="output"
3.14
```

This is because `math.Pi` is a constant and can be determined at compile time.

If we were to introduce a function call, the compiler would throw an error.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func main() {
  const Pi = math.Sin(1.57)

  fmt.Println(Pi)
}
```

The output of the above code is:

```bash title="output"
./expr.go:12:13: math.Sin(1.57) (value of type float64) is not constant
```

Function calls are not allowed in constants because the value of the function call cannot be determined at compile time.

Other types that cannot be used in constants are:

- Function calls
- Array and slice literals

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to declare constants in Go. We have also learned about some of the edge cases that can occur when declaring constants.
