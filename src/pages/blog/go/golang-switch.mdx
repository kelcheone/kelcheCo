## What is Switch Statement in Go?

Switch statement in Go is a control flow statement that is used to execute a block of code among many alternatives. Switch statements are declared using the `switch` keyword followed by the condition to be evaluated. The condition can be a variable, constant, or expression.

The `switch` statement is similar to the `if-else` statement. The difference is that the `switch` statement can have multiple cases. The `switch` statement is also known as the `switch-case` statement.

## Syntax of Switch Statement in Go

The syntax of the `switch` statement in Go is as follows:

```go title="example.go"
switch condition {
    case value1:
        // code block
    default:
        // code block
}
```

The `switch` statement is followed by the `case` keyword. The `case` keyword is followed by the value to be compared with the condition. The `case` keyword is followed by the code block to be executed if the condition is equal to the value. The `default` keyword is used to execute a block of code if none of the cases is true.

## Example of Switch Statement in Go

The following example shows the use of the `switch` statement in Go:

```go title="example.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var num int = 10
    switch num {
        case 10:
            fmt.Println("Number is 10")
        default:
            fmt.Println("Number is not 10 or 20")
    }
}
```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
Number is 10
```

## Switch Statement with Multiple Cases

The `switch` statement can have multiple cases, you can have as many cases as you want. The following example shows the use of the `switch` statement with multiple cases:

```go title="example.go"
...
switch num {
    case 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 10")
    case 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 20")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Number is not 10 or 20")
}
```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
Number is 20
```

## Switch Statement with Fallthrough

Fallthrough is a keyword that is used to execute the next case in a `switch` statement. The `fallthrough` keyword is used to execute the next case even if the condition is not true. The following example shows the use of the `fallthrough` keyword:

```go title="example.go"
...
switch num {
    case 10:
        fmt.Println("Number is 10")
        fallthrough
    case 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 20")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Number is not 10 or 20")
}
```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
Number is 10
Number is 20
```

In the above example case 10 is executed and then the `fallthrough` keyword is used to execute the next case which is case 20.

## golang switch case break

The `break` keyword is used to terminate the `switch` statement when a given condition is true.

The following example shows the use of the `break` keyword:

```go title="example.go"
...
num := 10
switch num {
    case 10:
        break
        fmt.Println("Number is 10")
    case 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 20")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Number is not 10 or 20")
}
```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"

```

Nothing is printed because the switch statement is terminated after the `break` keyword.

## golang switch channel

<Nugget>
  <strong> A channel </strong> is a communication mechanism that allows one
  goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutine.
</Nugget>

The following example shows the use of the `switch` statement with a channel:

```go title="example.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
		c1 <- "one"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
		c2 <- "two"
	}()

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-c1:
			fmt.Println("received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-c2:
			fmt.Println("received", msg2)
		}
	}
}

```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
received one
received two
```

In the above example, the `select` statement is used to receive the values from the channel. The `select` statement is used to receive the values from the channel. The `select` statement is used to receive the values from the channel.

## Switch Statement with Multiple Conditions

The `switch` statement can have multiple conditions using the `||`, `&&`, and `!` operators. The following example shows the use of the `switch` statement with multiple conditions:

```go title="example.go"
...
num := 10
x := 20
switch {
    case num == 10 && x == 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 10 and x is 20")
    case num == 20 && x == 20:
        fmt.Println("Number is 20 and x is 20")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Number is not 10 or 20")
}
```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
Number is 10 and x is 20
```

In the above example, the `switch` statement is used to check if the `num` variable is equal to 10 and the `x` variable is equal to 20.

## Switch Statement with Type Switch

The `switch` statement can be used to check the type of a variable using the `type` keyword. By combining `type` and `:=` we can create a type <b> switch guard </b>. The following example shows the use of the `switch` statement with the `type` keyword:

```go title="example.go"

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x interface{}

    switch i := x.(type) {
    case nil:
        fmt.Printf("x's type: %T\n", i)
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("x is int\n")
    case float64:
        fmt.Printf("x is float64\n")
    case func(int) float64:
        fmt.Printf("x is func(int)\n")
    case bool, string:
        fmt.Printf("x is bool or string\n")
    default:
        fmt.Printf("don't know the type\n")
    }
}

```

The output of the above program is:

```bash title="output"
x's type: <nil>
```

if we change the value of the `x` variable to `10` the output will be:

```bash title="output"
x is int
```

## Tl;dr

      * The `switch` statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable.
      * The `switch` statement can have multiple cases, you can have as many cases as you want.
      * The `switch` statement can have multiple conditions using the `||`, `&&`, and `!` operators.
      * The `switch` statement can be used to check the type of a variable using the `type` keyword.
