## What is Enum in Golang?

Enum is a type that consists of a set of named constants they can also be referred to as <i>enumarated constants</i>. Constants are used to represent a fixed value that the program may not alter during its execution.

## How to Define Enum in Golang

In Go, we can define an enum using the `const` keyword. The `const` keyword is used to declare a constant value. They are declared outside the function and can be used anywhere in the program.

The following is an example of how to define an enum in Golang.

```go title=” example.go”
...
const (
    value1 = 1
    value2 = 2
    value3 = 3
)
...
```

In the above example, we have defined an enum with three values `value1`, `value2`, and `value3`.

## How to Use Enum in Golang?

We can use the enum values in the program by using the `const` keyword. The following is an example of how to use an enum in Golang.

```go title="main.go"
...
const (
    value1 = 1
    value2 = 2
    value3 = 3
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(value1)
    fmt.Println(value2)
    fmt.Println(value3)
}
...
```

In this example, we have used the enum values in the `main` function.

## Enums and Iota

The `iota` keyword is a predeclared identifier in Golang. It is used to represent successive untyped integer constants. It is used to generate a sequence of integer constants. The sequence starts at zero and increments by one.
The following is an example of how to use `iota` to define an enum.

```go title="main.go"
...
const (
    value1 = iota + 1
    value2
    value3
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(value1)
    fmt.Println(value2)
    fmt.Println(value3)
}
```

output:

```bash title="output"
1
2
3
```

In the above instance `value1` is assigned the value `1` and the rest automatically increment by one.

## How to iterate over an Enum in Golang?

To iterate over an enum in Golang, we can use the `for` loop. The following is an example of how to iterate over an enum in Golang.

```go title="main.go"

...
const (
    value1 = iota + 1
    value2
    value3
)

func main() {
    for i := value1; i <= value3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

By using `iota` we generated a sequence of integer constants. We can use the `for` loop to iterate over the sequence.

To skip a value in the sequence, we can use the `_` operator.

```go title="main.go"
    ...
    const (
        value1 = iota + 1
        value2
        _ // skip value3
        value4
    )
    ...
```

The above example will skip the value `3` in the sequence.

## Enum string values

We can assign string values to an enum. The following is an example of how to assign string values to an enum.

```go title="main.go"
...
const (
    value1 = "value1"
    value2 = "value2"
    value3 = "value3"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(value1)
    fmt.Println(value2)
    fmt.Println(value3)
}
```

output:

```bash title="output"
value1
value2
value3
```

## golang enum type

We can also define an enum type in Golang. The following is an example of how to define an enum type in Golang.

```go title="main.go"
...
type EnumType int

const (
    value1 EnumType = iota + 1
    value2
    value3
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(value1)
    fmt.Println(value2)
    fmt.Println(value3)
}
```

output:

```bash title="output"
1
2
3
```

In the above example, we have defined an enum type `EnumType` and assigned the values `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` to it

## Enum Example in Golang

The following is an example of how to use an enum in Golang.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

type Subject int

const (
    English     Subject = iota + 1
    Geography
    Mathematics
    Physics
    Chemistry
    Biology
)

// String returns the string representation of the Subject
func (s Subject) String() string {
    return [...]string{"English", "Kiswahili", "Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology"}[s-1]
}

// Index returns the index of the Subject
func (s Subject) Index() int {
    return int(s)
}

func main() {
    subject := Biology
    fmt.Println(subject) // Biology
    fmt.Println(subject.Index()) // 6
    fmt.Println(subject.String()) // Biology
}

```

output:

```bash title="output"
Biology
6
Biology
```

We have defined an enum type `Subject` and assigned the values `English`, `Geography`, `Mathematics`, `Physics`, `Chemistry`, and `Biology` to it. We have also defined two methods `String` and `Index` to return the string representation and the index of the subject respectively.

## Tl;dr

- Enum is a type that consists of a set of named constants that can also be referred to as <i>enumarated constants</i>.
- We can define an enum using the `const` keyword.
