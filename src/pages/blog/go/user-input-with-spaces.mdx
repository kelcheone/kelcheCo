## Introduction

When you are building a command line application in Golang, you'll often need to accept user input. These inputs can sometimes contain spaces. For example, your program is a bookstore search engine. You want to accept a search query from the user. The user might enter something like "The Lord of the Rings". If you're using the conventional `fmt.Scan...` functions, you'll only get the first word unless you use a loop to read the rest of the input. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to accept user input with spaces in Golang.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Enter a title: ")
	var title string
	_, err := fmt.Scan(&title)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("You entered: ", title)
}

```

By running the above program, you'll see that only the first word is read. The rest of the input is ignored.

```bash title="Terminal"
❯ go run main.go
Enter a title:
Lord of the rings
You entered:  Lord
❯ of the rings
zsh: command not found: of
```

As you can see in the above example, the program only reads the first word. The rest of the input is ignored and even causes errors in the terminal.

## Reading user input with spaces

To read user input with spaces, we'll use the `bufio` package. This package provides a buffered reader that can read a line of input from the command line.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
 "bufio"
 "fmt"
 "os"
)

func main() {
 reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
    fmt.Print("Enter a title: ")
 title, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
    fmt.Println("You entered: ", title)
}
```

The above program reads a line of input from the command line and prints it to the terminal. The `ReadString` function reads a line of input from the command line and stops when it encounters the specified delimiter. In this case, we're using the newline character `\n` as the delimiter.

```bash title="Terminal"
$ go run main.go
Enter a Title: The Lord of the Rings
You entered: The Lord of the Rings
$
```

Unlike the `fmt.Scan` function, the `bufio` package reads the entire line of input. This means that the user can enter as many words as they want.

This is but one of the powers of the `bufio` package. You can learn more from this <Link url="/blog/go/golang-bufio/">Golang bufio tutorial</Link>.
