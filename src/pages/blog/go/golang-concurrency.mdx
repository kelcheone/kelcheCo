## Introduction

### Concurrency

Concurrency is the ability of a program to run multiple tasks at the same time. Concurrency is important for programs that need to do m>

### Goroutines

Goroutines enable concurrency in Go. Goroutines can be defined as a lightweight thread of execution. Goroutines are multiplexed onto mu>

### Goroutine Scheduling

Goroutines are scheduled by the Go runtime. The Go runtime uses a cooperative scheduling model. This means that goroutines are schedule>

### How Goroutines Work

When a Go program starts, it creates a single goroutine, called the main goroutine. The main goroutine is responsible for calling the m>

Goroutines are scheduled by the Go runtime. The Go runtime uses a scheduler to schedule goroutines onto OS threads. The Go runtime uses>

Another important thing to note is that goroutines are not preemptively scheduled. This means that goroutines are not scheduled based o>
