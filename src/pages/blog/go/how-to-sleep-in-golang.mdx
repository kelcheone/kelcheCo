Pausing the execution of a program is a common task in programming. Be it to wait for a network connection to complete or to wait for a user to press a key, among many other things. Golang is no exception to these tasks. In this article, we will learn how to sleep in Golang.

## Sleeping in Golang

**To sleep in Golang, the time.Sleep() function is used. This function takes a time duration as an argument and will pause the execution of the current thread for the specified duration.**

### Importing the time Package

To use the time.Sleep() function, the time package must be imported.

```go title="main.go"
...
import "time"
...
```

### using time.Sleep()

The `time.Sleep()` function takes a time duration as an argument. The time duration can be specified in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds. The time duration is specified using the `time.Duration` type. The `time.Duration` type is an alias for the `int64` type. The `time.Duration` type is used to represent a time duration in nanoseconds.

```go title="main.go"
...
time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
...
```

Here we are pausing the execution of the current thread for 1 second. The `time.Second` constant is a `time.Duration` type that represents 1 second in nanoseconds. The `time.Second` constant is defined as `1e9` nanoseconds.

### Example

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main(){
    fmt.Println("Sleeping for 1 second...")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Done sleeping.")
}
```

## Sleep in a Loop

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main(){
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Sleeping for 1 second...")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    }
    fmt.Println("Done sleeping.")
}
```

## Sleep for Goroutines

Pausing a goroutine is a common task given that goroutines are used to run concurrent tasks, it is often necessary to pause one goroutine while the others run. To pause a goroutine, the time.Sleep() function is also used.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main(){
    go func(){
        fmt.Println("Sleeping for 5 seconds...")
        time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
        fmt.Println("Done sleeping.")
    }()
    fmt.Println("Waiting for goroutine to finish...")
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Done waiting.")
}
```

```bash title="Output"
Waiting for goroutine to finish...
Sleeping for 5 seconds...
Done sleeping.
Done waiting.
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to sleep in Golang. We demonstrated how to sleep using the `time` package and the `time.Sleep()` function. We also learned how to sleep in a loop and how to sleep for goroutines.
