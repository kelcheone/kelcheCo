## Introduction

**There are two ways to copy a slice in Golang. You can use the built-in `copy` function or use the `append` function.**

### 1. The copy function <SectionLink client:load id="1-the-copy-function" />

To copy a slice in Golang, you can use the built-in copy function. This function takes two arguments: the destination slice and the source slice. The copy function will copy the elements from the source slice to the destination slice.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := make([]int, 5)

    copy(destination, source)

    fmt.Println(destination)
}
```

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
[1 2 3 4 5]
```

If the destination slice is smaller than the source slice, the copy function will only copy the number of elements fitting the destination slice.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := make([]int, 3)

    copy(destination, source)

    fmt.Println(destination)
}
```

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
[1 2 3]
```

If the destination slice is larger than the source slice, the copy function will copy all the elements from the source slice and leave the remaining elements in the destination slice unchanged.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := make([]int, 10)

    copy(destination, source)

    fmt.Println(destination)
}
```

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
[1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0]
```

<Nugget>
  <p>
    By default, the value of an uninitialized element in a slice is the zero
    value of the element type. In the example above, the zero value of an an
    integer is 0.
  </p>
</Nugget>

To make sure that you copy all the elements from the source, get the length of the source and use it to create the destination slice.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := make([]int, len(source))

    copy(destination, source)

    fmt.Println(destination)
}
```

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
[1 2 3 4 5]
```

The copy function returns the number of elements copied. This value returned is used to check if the copy was successful.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := make([]int, 3)

    copied := copy(destination, source)

    fmt.Println(copied)
}
```

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
3
```

### 2. The append function <SectionLink client:load id="2-the-append-function" />

To copy a slice in Golang, you can also use the `append` function. This function takes two arguments: the destination slice and the source slice. The `append` function will copy the elements from the source slice to the destination slice.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    source := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    destination := append([]int{}, source...)

    fmt.Println(destination)
}
```

You need to spread the source slice using the `...` operator.

The output of the program is:

```bash title="output"
[1 2 3 4 5]
```

The downside of using the `append` function is that it will allocate excess memory. So it is not recommended to use it for smaller slices.

## 3. Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to copy a slice in Golang. We learned that there are two ways to copy a slice in Golang; the `copy` function and the `append` function.
