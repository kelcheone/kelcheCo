## Introduction

The Go programming language has a comprehensive standard library for working with files and directories. The `path/filepath` package provides utilities for handling file paths. Filepaths are an essential part of any application that needs to work with files and directories in the filesystem. The `path/filepath` package provides several useful functions for working with file paths. This article will provide a comprehensive guide to working with file paths in Go. Let's get started.

## Filepaths in Golang <SectionLink client:load id="filepath-in-golang" />

In Golang, a file path is a string that represents the location of a file or a folder in the file system. Filepaths are used to access and manipulate files and folders programmatically. A file path can be absolute or relative. An absolute file path is a file path that starts with the root folder and provides a complete path to the files or folder(`/home/user/file.txt`), on the other hand, a relative path is based on the current folder and provides a path just relative to it(`./file.txt`). The `path/filepath` package provides several functions for working with file paths in Go.

## Working with Filepaths <SectionLink client:load id="working-with-filepaths" />

To work with file paths you'll need to import the `path/filepath` package.

```go
...
import "path/filepath"
```

## Joining Filepaths <SectionLink client:load id="joining-filepaths" />

To join two or more file paths, the `filepath.Join()` function is used. This is a variadic function that takes in several file paths and returns a single file path. This function is useful for constructing file paths from several parts.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Join("home", "user", "file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
home/user/file.txt
```

## Get Directory of a File or Folder <SectionLink client:load id="returning-directory-of-a-file-or-folder" />

To get the directory of a file, the `filepath.Dir()` function is used. This function takes in a file path and returns the directory of the file.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Dir("home/user/file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
home/user
```

## Get the Base of a File or Folder <SectionLink client:load id="returning-the-base-of-a-file-or-folder" />

The `filepath.Base()` function is used to get the base of a file or folder. This function takes in a file path and returns the base of the file or folder. The base of a file or folder is the last part of the file path.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Base("home/user/file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
file.txt
```

This is the inverse of the `filepath.Dir()` function.

## Get the Absolute Filepath <SectionLink client:load id="returning-the-absolute-filepath" />

To get the absolute file path of a file or folder, the `filepath.Abs()` function is used. This function takes in a file path and returns the absolute file path of the file or folder. If the file path given is not absolute, it will append the current folder to the file path.

Two values are returned by the `filepath.Abs()` function. The first value is the absolute file path and the second value is an error.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Abs("file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
/home/user/file.txt <nil>
```

We can also check if a file path is absolute or not using the `filepath.IsAbs()` function. This function takes in a file path and returns a boolean value indicating if the file path is absolute or not.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.IsAbs("file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
false
```

## Get the Relative Filepath <SectionLink client:load id="returning-the-relative-filepath" />

The `filepath.Rel()` function is used to get the relative file path of a file or folder. This function takes in two file paths, the base path, and the target path, and returns the relative file path of the target path from the base path.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Rel("home/user", "home/user/file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
file.txt <nil>
```

## Get Matching Files <SectionLink client:load id="returning-matching-files" />

To get a list of files that match a pattern, the `filepath.Glob()` function is used. This function takes in a pattern and returns a list of files that match the pattern. The pattern can be a simple string or a regular expression. If there are no files that match the pattern, an empty list is returned.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    files, _ := filepath.Glob("*.txt")
    fmt.Println(files)
}
```

```bash title="output"
[file.txt]
```

## Get the Extension of a File <SectionLink client:load id="returning-the-extension-of-a-file" />

To get the extension of a file, the `filepath.Ext()` function is used. This function takes in a file path and returns the extension of the file. The extension of a file is the part of the file path after the last `.`.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(filepath.Ext("file.txt"))
}
```

```bash title="output"
.txt
```
